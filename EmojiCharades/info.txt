Welcome to Emoji Charades!

To participate you first need to sign in with your gmail account.

Once signed in you can send a message to any other gmail users.

Messages should only contain emoji, so the reciever can guess what you were trying to say.

for example: If I sent you "😎👈💞🍕" you would want to replay "I love pizza"

Once you respond, I get to decided if you answered correctly or not.

If you did, you get a point, if not I get a point.

Now sign in and get started.
